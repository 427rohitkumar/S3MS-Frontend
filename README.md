# 📚 S3MS Frontend

S3MS is a smart seat & subscription management platform designed for **private study libraries** that provide personal learning environments such as tables, internet, AC rooms, silent zones, and more. Unlike traditional libraries, it helps library owners manage **seat availability, student allocation, memberships, and profit insights**—all from one clean dashboard.

This repository contains the **frontend codebase** for GrowwLibrary, developed with **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS** for blazing-fast performance and modular design.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Empower library owners to manage **limited seat capacities** through intelligent multi-shift logic.
- Enable students to book time slots and access seats via **subscription-based plans**.
- Track **real-time seat usage**, send reminders, and optimize space utilization.
- Analyze **revenue vs utility costs** to help small study spaces run efficiently.
